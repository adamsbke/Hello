		<h3>Research Experience </h3>
		<p></p>
		<p>During my junior year, I was admitted for Undergraduate Research Program (URP) in the College of Science and Technology at Temple University. My research topic was to explore wireless network requirements for next generation surveillance systems. During the project we came with the hypothesis that WiMax/LTE is the key technology for such system, compared with WIFI and other technologies. I was assigned to investigate GENI WiMax deployment in five different universities and based on our research results we produced a prototype system. Based on my motivation and my determination on this project my mentor proposed me to continue working with him as research assistant. In summer 2012, I was conceded in NSF/DoD Research Experience for Undergraduates in Next Generation Networking Technologies at Center of Networked Computing (CNC). I was responsible to study the performance of Temple University WiMax. During this program, I presented active measurement results from Temple University WiMax based network with primary focus on link performance. Since the deployment of TU-WiMAX base station, I was the first to write a paper about its performance. I measured tree links performance, namely receive signal strength indicator (RSSI), carrier to interference plus noise ratio (CINR),  and bandwidth. After depicting these measurement values, I analyzed and provided estimation of the actual system rate, and finally I presented an approach to predict the future state of link quality. The program was closed with  a poster forum where I presented my work to many students and mentors</p>	</div>
