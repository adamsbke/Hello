		<h3>Technical Skills </h3>
		<p>Temple University's College of Science and Technology B.S. program in Computer Science exposed me to a wide range of subjects including Data Structure, C++, JAVA, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms, Operating System Programming, Web App Development, and Mobile App Development. My dedication and hard work enable me to score a consistently good scholastic record. With knowledge through these undergraduate courses, I worked on a project titled "Temple University Map Application (TUMaps)". TUMap is Android application. My Contribution to this project has helped me hone my programming skills on real-life problem and modeled me into an efficient team player. We design the application to run on Android 3.0 using Eclipse IDE. So it is developed in Java coupled with XML for user interaction. We used Git version control for tracking, controlling, and merging changes to the remote Bitbucket repository. I was also responsible for Unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance Testing of the project. I used Robolectric framework to test the entire project so that testing run fast because Robolectric runs test case outside of emulator in Java virtual machine.  In addition to these technical skills, my summer 2012 research program (REU) increased and strengthened my research, communication and presentation skills. Every two weeks, I had 15 to 20 minutes PowerPoint presentation and I updated my technical paper. My self-directed and innovation skills allowed me to transcend during the poster forum of the program where I explained my project to many other mentors and students.  My strong Mathematics and physics background are the principal key to enhance my problem solving skills. My method to approach challenging and complex problem is divide and conquer. With this technique, I keep an open mind to boost creative thinking by dividing large problem into small pieces and solving each part then combine them. In the same ideology I prove the correctness of problem by induction.</p>
